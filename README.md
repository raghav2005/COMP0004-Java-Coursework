This is a Patient Data App.

It is my Java Coursework for the COMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming module of Year 1 Term 2 at UCL.

You can run the project with:

```bash 
$ mvn clean compile package exec:exec
```

I (unfortunately) used IntelliJ IDEA for this, even though I tried it with emacs & VSCode.
